* How we got to know each other

Jessica and Scott met each other during Jessica's freshman year of college.  They were introduced by a mutual friend who knew that Jessica was interested in a Computer Science degree.  Encouraged by the fact that she would have someone to help her, Jessica took her first computer science class.  Scott did indeed help her, but he didn't always do it in the nicest way.  <INSERT QUOTE FROM JESS HERE>.  Nevertheless, Jessica still chose to continue asking Scott for help because she "knew that it was making her a better coder."

Outside of class, Jessica and Scott consistently shared the same group of friends.  They went on many adventures, such as late night Korean BBQ runs, discovering the newest boba shops, and attending USC football games.  They also attended the same Bible study, and Jessica was never hesitant to jump into the front seat of Scott's car on the weekly drives to church.
