After a year and a half, Scott, Jessica, Philemon, and Ben (two of Scott's roommates) all went ice skating.  During ice skating, a lightbulb went off in Scott's head: Jess is cute!  As a sidenote, the only two other things Scott and Jess remember about that day was Philemon doing a double axel and Ben trying to learn how to skate backwards.  A few days later, Jessica asked Philemon to drive her to a coffee shop in the morning so she could study.  Philemon, feeling lazy, refused, and Scott volunteered to take her instead.  What started out as a study date turned into an actual date (and a harrowing adventure, as Scott turned the wrong way on a one-way street and had to do something like this: http://youtu.be/_z5LXyWn3-w?t=1m9s).  After much prayer and careful consideration about the other's character, Scott and Jess decided to start a relationship :)

Over the course of the relationship, Scott and Jessica have learned that they are opposite but complementary in many ways.  Scott is very opinionated about music, movies, and books, and he seeks to find the newest, greatest thing.  Jessica doesn't care to discover new art, so she enjoys the variety that Scott brings in.  Jessica is very good and patient at finding deals; Scott isn't.  Jessica is extroverted but shy; Scott is introverted but outgoing.  Jessica encourages Scott to meet new people, and Scott makes getting to know them easier.

The crucial element of the relationship's success is each person's love for Jesus Christ.  The Christian worldview is the foundation for all decisions that they make, and how well their relationship is doing is often based on how well their relationships with their Heavenly Father is doing.

We look forward to this new season of life, and we thank you for being a part of our lives.  Hopefully, you will continue to be a part of it in the future :)


#### Proposal

Jessica knew that a proposal was coming very soon.  I knew that she would suspect a proposal for anything extravagant or out-of-the-ordinary that I did.  So, I decided to disguise it by proposing to her on her birthday weekend.

We both really like puzzles.  It's at the core of what we do for work, and many of our leisure activities (playing games and doing crosswords, to name a couple) contain them as well.  So, I (Scott) decided to make a giant puzzle for Jessica to solve.

The day started with me taking her to brunch at Pasti's, a restaurant in Palo Alto.  Getting brunch, especially at a place we haven't been before, is one of our favorite activities.  At brunch, I revealed that Mr. Piffles (her stuffed penguin) (((insert picture))) had a letter for her.  It was a request to help him find Mrs. Piffles!

Each clue involved multiple parts: a place to find, a person to contact, and an object to photograph.  This quest to find Mrs. Piffles took us all around the South Bay, including an art shop, a cafe, a shopping mall, and a friend's house.  Finally, all of the objects photographed could be interpreted as letters which spelled "PARK," the location of the missing penguin!

At the park, Micah, Clayton, and Missy (Jessica's high school friends) had set up a picnic blanket with roses, apple cider, and the missing penguin under a tree where Jessica and I had a picnic.  As we walked into the park, Jessica was dismayed that "someone had taken our spot!"  Undeterred, I coolly (or so I thought) suggested that we should walk in the grass which just happened to cross paths with the rose-covered picnic blanket.  We sat under the tree, and I gave her a letter to read.  As she finished the letter, I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.  She said yes!  Afterwards, Jessica's friends came and tackled her, and we rejoiced.
